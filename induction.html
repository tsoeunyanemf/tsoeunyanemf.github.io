									<h2>Reflections on my learning experience</h2>
									<p>
										From the tutor’s feedback, I could understand two essential rules I will pay attention to in the next assignments:
										<ol>
											<li>It is recommended to include an equal number of industry reports and academic references.</li>
											<li>It is recommended to write the essay answering to all requirements in equal parts.</li>
										</ol>
										Kopernio is a very useful platform to enrich my research. In my following essays and articles I will defiantly use this tool. The assignment gave me the opportunity to research about the importance of a postgraduate degree and how it can affect the field and society at large. I was so excited about the impacts on the society that I ended up writing the article about with 2.371 words about how Computational Thinking Education can reshape the world after COVID-19.

											Workforce of the future: how Computational Thinking can reshape the world after COVID-19?<br><br>
											Summary<br>
	
											This paper aims to discuss "technological unemployment" in the current Age of Automation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the growth of Artificial Intelligence to automate work tasks. Although new technologies can replace jobs, it can also ignite mechanisms to open up new opportunities for workers. In the long run, automation can create more jobs than it replaces. In order for this to happen, unemployment and inequality caused by automation will require new frameworks for government cooperation and new educational systems to help workers develop new skills. The focus of this article is to examine some the most in-demand skills for the future of work. 
										</p>
									</div>
									<p>I hope to publish this article in an educational magazine after having a feedback from my tutor. I am aware that this was not the aim of the module, but I simply love researching and writing. As a lawyer I published 3 law books (“Direito Sumular-STF”, “Direito Sumular-STJ” and “Banking Law”) and around 80 articles in various journals and law magazines.</p>

								<p>This ePortfolio was carefully designed to demonstrate my mastery over the first two Modules of the MSc in Computer Science at the University of Essex: Induction Module and Module 1: "Launching into Computer Science," which contains 12 Units.  As you navigate through my ePortfolio, you will see my journey and studies of the material. The real value of this ePortfolio is in the learning experience and reflections over my personal development that are here documented.
